|Operator |	Name |	Description |
|---------|-------|----------------|
|a + b |	Addition |	Sum of a and b |
|a - b	| Subtraction |	Difference of a and b |
|a * b |	Multiplication |	Product of a and b |
|a / b	| True division |	Quotient of a and b |
|a // b | Floor division |	Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts|
|a % b |	Modulus	Integer | remainder after division of a by b|
|a ** b |	Exponentiation |	a raised to the power of b|
|-a	| Negation |	The negative of a|


**Order of operations**
The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. Some remember these by a mnemonic such as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.


**Comparison Operations**
| Operation |	Description |	Operation	Description |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
|a == b |	a equal to b	|	a != b	a not equal to b |
|a < b |	a less than b	|	a > b	a greater than b |
|a <= b |	a less than or equal to b	|	a >= b	a greater than or equal to b |
