-- AS is a convenient way to clean up the data returned by your query. 
--It's even more powerful when combined with WITH in what's called a 
--"common table expression".
--A common table expression (or CTE) is a temporary table that you return 
--within your query. CTEs are helpful for splitting your queries into 
--readable chunks, and you can write queries against them.
