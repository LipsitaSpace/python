--ORDER BY is usually the last clause in your query, 
--and it sorts the results returned by the rest of your query.
SELECT A,B,C
FROM `table`
ORDER BY A

--There are two ways that dates can be stored in BigQuery: 
--as a DATE or as a DATETIME.
YYYY-[M]M-[D]D
-- YYYY: Four-digit year
-- [M]M: One or two digit month
-- [D]D: One or two digit day

--Often you'll want to look at part of a date, like the year or the day. 
--You can do this with EXTRACT. We'll illustrate this with a slightly 
--different table, called pets_with_date.
SELECT N,EXTRACT(DAY from Date) AS DAY
FROM `table`

SELECT N,EXTRACT(WEEK from Date) AS Week
FROM `table`
